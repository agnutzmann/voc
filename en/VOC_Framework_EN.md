# Vulnerability Operations Center (VOC) Framework

## 1. Introduction

Implementing a Vulnerability Operations Center (VOC) represents a strategic evolution in an organization’s cybersecurity approach, providing a continuous and structured process for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities. Unlike a Security Operations Center (SOC), which focuses on incident detection and response, the VOC seeks to eliminate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

Additionally, the VOC leverages information from **Risk Management** (which identifies broad organizational risks) to translate strategic risks into concrete, known or unknown vulnerabilities, enabling proactive mitigation.

**Key Reference Frameworks:**
- **NIST SP 800-40 (Guide to Enterprise Patch Management Technologies)**: Emphasizes a continuous process for managing vulnerabilities and patches.
- **ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)**: Provides guidelines for security controls, including vulnerability management (A.12.6.1).
- **CIS Controls (Critical Security Controls)**: CIS Control 7 highlights the need to prioritize vulnerabilities by risk.
- **MITRE ATT&CK (Threat Intelligence)**: Maps attack tactics and techniques, helping identify exploitable vulnerabilities.
- **OWASP (Web and API Security)**: Focuses on web application vulnerabilities, including the OWASP Top 10.
- **NIST SP 800-37 (Risk Management Framework - RMF)**: Integrates security and risk management.
- **ISO 31000 (Risk Management)**: Guidelines for enterprise risk management.
- **NIST 800-53 (Security and Privacy Controls)**: Provides a comprehensive list of security controls.
- **NIST SP 800-55 (Performance Measurement for Information Security)**: Offers guidelines for metrics and performance indicators.

## 2. Objective

This framework aims to establish a clear structure to:

- **Manage vulnerabilities in a centralized manner**, preventing security risks before they are exploited.
- **Ensure compliance** with regulations and standards such as ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and GDPR.
- **Prioritize remediation based on business impact**, reducing exposure to cyber threats.
- **Integrate automation and continuous monitoring** of vulnerabilities in hybrid environments (on-premises and cloud).
- **Promote executive visibility and strategic reporting** to support decision-making.

**Example Success Metrics:**
- Reduction in **mean time to remediate (MTTR)** for critical vulnerabilities.
- Increase in security scan coverage to **100%** of assets.
- 95% compliance with **remediation SLAs**.
- 90% reduction in **residual risk** after remediating critical vulnerabilities.

## 3. VOC Governance and Authority

To ensure VOC success, it must operate with **authority granted by top management**, ensuring autonomy to:

1. Manage and oversee the implementation of security patches, enforcing compliance across IT assets.  
2. Define deadlines and criticality levels for remediation, based on business impact.  
3. Escalate critical vulnerabilities to senior leadership if they remain unmitigated within the defined timeframe.  
4. Define compliance metrics and SLAs, holding responsible teams accountable.  
5. Align with organizational policies such as asset management, regulatory compliance, and DevSecOps.

**Policies Related to the VOC:**
- **Vulnerability Management Policy (NIST SP 800-40)**: Identification, prioritization, and remediation of vulnerabilities.
- **Patch Management Policy (CIS Control 7, ISO 27001 - A.12.6.1)**: Sets deadlines and criteria for patch application.
- **Application Security Policy (DevSecOps)**: Integrates security into the SDLC (software development lifecycle).
- **Incident Management Policy (NIST SP 800-61)**: Defines procedures for incidents related to vulnerabilities.
- **Regulatory Compliance Management Policy**: Ensures alignment with standards like ISO, GDPR, PCI-DSS, etc.

## 4. VOC Operational Process

The VOC follows a continuous and iterative lifecycle consisting of three main phases: **Input**, **Processing**, and **Output**. To streamline the process, activities such as **detection, analysis, prioritization, mitigation, and validation** are unified under **Processing** (playbook).

### 4.1. Input (Sources of Vulnerability Identification)

- **Security Scanners**: Tools (Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7, OpenVAS, etc.) to identify technical vulnerabilities.
- **Pentest Reports**: Penetration tests conducted internally or by third parties.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Data from sources such as CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities), MITRE ATT&CK, and threat feeds.
- **Risk Management (GRC)**: Risks identified that may translate into operational vulnerabilities.

### 4.2. Processing (Unified Playbook)

To ensure an efficient operation, the VOC should follow **clear workflows** covering detection through validation and reporting. Below is an example of a unified flow:

1. **Detection**  
   - Use of automated tools (scanners, SIEMs) to identify vulnerabilities.  
   - Collection of Threat Intelligence data to contextualize potential threats.

2. **Analysis**  
   - Classification of the vulnerability based on CVSS and EPSS.  
   - Assessment of business impact (financial, operational, reputational).

3. **Prioritization**  
   - Setting severity levels (critical, high, medium, low).  
   - Establishing SLAs according to severity and business impact.

4. **Mitigation**  
   - Applying patches or implementing compensating controls.  
   - Coordinating with IT and DevSecOps teams to ensure effective fixes.

5. **Validation**  
   - Checking the effectiveness of the mitigation (validation tests and rescans).  
   - Updating vulnerability status in the management system.

6. **Reporting**  
   - Generating executive reports with metrics (MTTR, MTTI, etc.).  
   - Communicating vulnerability status and SLA compliance to senior management.

### 4.3. Output (Action Plans and Reports)

Upon completion of **Processing**, the VOC provides tangible outputs to the organization:

- **Action Plans**: Specific measures to correct or mitigate vulnerabilities.  
- **Patch Management**: Implementing patches within deadlines set by criticality.  
- **Executive Reports**: Dashboards and insights on status and progress of remediation.  
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Using automation to detect new vulnerabilities and ensure compliance.

## 5. Tools and Automation

Automation is critical to VOC effectiveness, enabling greater speed, accuracy, and efficiency. Examples of tool categories include:

- **SIEM** (e.g., Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel): Event correlation and vulnerability detection.
- **SOAR** (e.g., Cortex XSOAR, Splunk Phantom): Automated incident response and security process orchestration.
- **DevSecOps Tools** (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI): Integration of security into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Vulnerability Scanners** (e.g., Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7, OpenVAS): Automated detection across infrastructure and applications.
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms** (e.g., MISP, ThreatConnect, AlienVault OTX): Collection/analysis of threat intelligence.
- **Patch Management** (e.g., WSUS, SCCM, Ansible, Tanium): Automation and control of security updates.
- **Container/Kubernetes Security** (e.g., Aqua Security, Trivy, Sysdig Secure): Detecting vulnerabilities in containerized/orchestrated environments.
- **Compliance and GRC Management** (e.g., ServiceNow GRC, RSA Archer, OneTrust): Ensuring adherence to regulations and security policies.

## 6. Risks Associated with Vulnerability Management

The VOC must be aware of risks that can affect vulnerability management, such as:

- **Shadow IT**: Lack of visibility into assets not managed by official IT.
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Potential vulnerabilities in external provider systems.
- **Communication Failures**: Issues in information sharing among SOC, IT, GRC, etc.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Risks of non-compliance with regulations like GDPR, PCI-DSS.

---

## 7. Alignment with Privacy Regulations

The VOC is pivotal in protecting sensitive data and complying with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). Recommended practices include:

- **Mapping Privacy-Related Vulnerabilities**: Identifying vulnerabilities that may expose personal data.
- **Continuous Audit Controls**: Ensuring ongoing compliance and traceability.
- **Compliance Reports**: Demonstrating adherence to applicable regulations.

Notes:
- (*) In some cases, the Patching Specialist may also join testing if reapplication or further configuration is needed.
- The Vulnerability Engineer and Threat Intelligence Analyst can both be “R” for identifying vulnerabilities (tools vs. intelligence). Adjust as needed for your organization's realities.
- Typically, there is **1 “Accountable”** (A) per activity, though multiple “Responsible” roles may exist for shared execution.
